## Installation

1. Copy `lovelace-swipe-navigation.js` in to `/www/lovelace-swipe-navigation/`

2. Add the resource in `ui-lovelace.yaml` or by using the "Raw Config Editor".
```yaml
resources:
  # increase this version number at end of URL after each update
  - url: /local/lovelace-swipe-navigation/lovelace-swipe-navigation.js?v=1.0.0
    type: js
```
3. That's it, nothing to configure and no card to add.
